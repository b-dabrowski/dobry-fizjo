# Images Folder Structure

This folder contains all the images used throughout the rehabilitation office website. The structure is organized by website sections:

## Folder Organization

- **hero/** - Images for the main hero/banner section
- **services/** - Images related to rehabilitation services offered
- **team/** - Photos of team members and staff
- **testimonials/** - Client photos or related imagery
- **gallery/** - Gallery images showcasing the facility, equipment, or treatments
- **blog/** - Images for blog posts and articles
- **contact/** - Images for the contact/location section

## Image Guidelines

- Use optimized formats (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
- Recommended max width: 1920px for hero images, 800px for other sections
- Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `physiotherapy-treatment-room.jpg`)

## Usage in Components

Images are accessible via `/images/[folder]/[filename]` in your React components.
